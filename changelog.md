## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-07

### Fixed — All Docs
- **Tech v2 + v2_visual:** Remove orphaned stats-blocks (138 lines each, positioned outside `<details>` elements). Insert `quick-stats` price-action grid + fundamentals grid in 15 active stock cards. Replace CSS with clean consolidated stylesheet. Add hamburger nav for mobile. ([21bb0e5](https://github.com/Brianartex/Brian-stock-research/commit/21bb0e5))
- **Tech v3 + v4:** Clean CSS refresh (removed stale mobile overrides). Add hamburger nav for mobile. Cards already had complete `price-action-bar` + `fundamentals-grid` — no content surgery needed. ([21bb0e5](https://github.com/Brianartex/Brian-stock-research/commit/21bb0e5))
- **Geopolitical v2 + v2_visual:** Clean CSS refresh (CSS shrank ~5KB by removing redundant rules). Add hamburger nav for mobile. Visual preserves Chart.js, sectorChart, spikeChart. ([21bb0e5](https://github.com/Brianartex/Brian-stock-research/commit/21bb0e5))

### Added — Orchestration Layer

- **`changelog.md`** — Append-only changelog. Generated from git commits. Follows Keep a Changelog format.
- **`project-state` skill** — Loads `project_state.json` at session start, enforces state update after complex tasks.

### Added
- **Orchestration layer** — `project_state.md`, `todo.md`, `changelog.md` for persistent session memory
- **Project state skill** — auto-loads at session start, updates after major tasks

### Changed
- **Tech_Stock_Basket_May_2026_v2.html** — Per-card stats insertion with real yfinance data
  - Replaced placeholder stat-row blocks with live `quick-stats` (price action: 6M/90D/30D/YTD; fundamentals: revenue, FCF margin, gross margin, net cash, GAAP op. margin)
  - Clean CSS replacement: mobile responsive (Galaxy S21/768px breakpoint), hamburger nav, ADA compliance
  - Orphaned `stats-section`/`fund-section` blocks removed (1,786 lines deleted, 369 lines added)
  - Hamburger nav HTML + JS injected (`mobile-topbar`, `nav-overlay`, `hamburger-btn`)

## [2026-05-12] — v5 Deep-Dive Live + Tech Doc Refresh

### Added
- **investment-deep-dive-v5.html** — 10-pick asymmetric basket with macro dashboard, performance tracker, position sizing, earnings calendar, stop-losses. FLNC overhang alert added post S-3ASR. SIVE added as 10th pick (CPO/photonics).
- **Morgan action sheet** — Discord-only actionable doc with allocations, entries, stops, and buying sequence. Sent to #investment.
- **index.html** — Archive restructured: hierarchical by document → month → week with version links. External section removed.
- **archive.html** — Full version history page with all historical releases, dates, and version numbers.
- **Tech doc v3** — Watchlist section added with AMBA (edge AI/robot vision, $60–65 target) and VICR (power modules, scouting). Scouting list for WYFI/NBIS/CRWV.
- **project_state.json** — Created with machine-readable state of all docs, blockers, upcoming dates, and pending work.

### Changed
- **Tech doc v3** — All 23 inline prices refreshed to May 12 afternoon. QCOM re-rated to WATCH after -12.4% broad-tech drop (no company-specific news). P/E compressed to 19.6x forward. Entry target revised to $175–180.
- **Morgan approved** for Discord bot pairing (user ID: 894243263777763389).

### Fixed
- Desktop nav bar TOC overlap — shifted right by `--toc-width` so nav links are fully clickable.
- SIVE card nesting — added missing `</div>` closures so SIVE renders as sibling to VST, not child.
- Orphaned risk-meter dots removed from below SIVE card.
- Archive TOC clipping — removed inline `max-height:0` constraints; expanded groups use 2000px.
